ARC

The Advanced Research Computing (ARC) system is a high performance computing facility based at the University of Leeds. This repo is a clone of my home directory on ARC, including useful scripts for running BISICLES and processing its outputs. Information on how to apply to ARC and how to use a HPC is available in the [ARC documentation](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/welcome.html).

### items

- `libs`: library of useful scripts
- `bisicles.yml`: conda environment used when running BISICLES
- `postprocessing.yml`: conda environment used for postprocessing of BISICLES outputs
